Public Class PICVar

    '==============================================================================================
    ' COBOL PIC varaibles have their own object type as they have a number of relevant properties.
    ' They can be numeric or alphanumeric, signed or unsigned, and have a length which means
    ' they function alittle like an array.
    ' The sign is important since unsigned PICS are assigned the absolute value if a signed digit
    ' is assigned to them.
    '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Public VarName As String = ""
    Public IsSigned As Boolean = False
    Public IsNumeric As Boolean = False
    Public Length As Integer = 1

End Class
